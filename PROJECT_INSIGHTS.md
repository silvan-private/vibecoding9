# Project Insights and Key Learnings

This document tracks important technical decisions, solved problems, and key insights gained during the development of this project. It serves as a quick reference for developers and AI assistants working on the codebase.

## System Requirements and Limitations

### Windows Permissions and File Operations

**Issue**: Windows requires elevated privileges for creating symlinks, which caused problems with SpeechBrain's default file handling.
**Solution**: Implemented direct file copying instead of symlinks.
**Implementation**: 
- Use `shutil.copy2()` for file operations
- Avoid setting symlink-related environment variables
- Created custom safe_link_strategy function that uses copying
**Reference**: See `audio_processor.py`

### Directory Structure Requirements

**Issue**: Missing embedding directory caused voice print saving to fail
**Solution**: Initialize all required directories during AudioProcessor initialization
**Implementation**:
- Add embedding_dir to AudioProcessor's __init__
- Create all required directories at startup
- Ensure directory exists before any file operations
**Reference**: See `audio_processor.py`

### Performance Characteristics

**Current Processing Speed**:
- Processing 1-minute chunks takes approximately 1 minute on CPU
- Main bottlenecks:
  - Whisper transcription (CPU-bound)
  - ECAPA-TDNN speaker embedding (CPU-bound)
  - Sequential processing of chunks

**Optimization Opportunities**:
1. GPU Acceleration:
   - Moving models to GPU could provide 5-10x speedup
   - Requires CUDA-enabled GPU and torch.cuda support
2. Batch Processing:
   - Process multiple chunks in parallel
   - Potential 2-4x speedup on multi-core CPUs
3. Model Optimization:
   - Use smaller Whisper model variant
   - Quantize models to INT8/FP16
   - Potential 2-3x speedup with minimal accuracy loss

**Reference Benchmarks**:
- CPU (current): ~60s per minute of audio
- GPU (estimated): ~10s per minute of audio
- GPU + Optimizations (estimated): ~3-5s per minute of audio

## Audio Processing

### Memory Management

**Issue**: Processing large audio files caused memory issues
**Solution**: 
- Implemented chunk-based processing (1-minute chunks)
- Added garbage collection after processing each chunk
- Added memory usage logging
**Reference**: See `analyze_speaker.py`

### File Caching

**Issue**: Repeated downloads of same audio segments
**Solution**: Implemented caching system for downloaded audio
- Cache key based on URL and time range
- Verification of cached files before use
**Reference**: See `audio_processor.py` _get_cached_audio method

## Best Practices

### Progress Tracking

**Implementation**: 
- Created ProgressTracker class for both file and console output
- Includes timestamps and percentage completion
- Maintains recent update history
**Reference**: See `analyze_speaker.py`

### Error Handling

**Best Practices**:
- Detailed error logging with tracebacks
- Graceful degradation when possible
- Clean up of incomplete files on error
- Memory usage logging during errors

## Known Limitations

1. CPU-only processing (FP32 instead of FP16)
2. Maximum recommended video length: 1 hour
3. Requires stable internet connection for YouTube downloads

## Future Improvements

1. Implement parallel processing for chunks
2. Add support for local video files
3. Improve speaker diarization accuracy
