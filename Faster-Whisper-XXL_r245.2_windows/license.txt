*** Usage Limitation on diarization with Rev models (aka Reverb) ***

MIT License doesn't extend on usage of diarization with Reverb models!
Rev models and usage of those models is under the Rev Model Non-Production License.
You shall only use the Rev Models and Outputs for testing, research, Personal, or evaluation purposes in Non-Production Environments.

You shall not supply the Rev Models, Derivatives, or Outputs in the course of a commercial activity, whether in return for payment or free of charge, in any medium or form, including but not limited to through a hosted or managed service (e.g. SaaS, cloud instances, etc.), or behind a software layer. 

“Non-Production Environment” means any setting, use case, or application of the Rev Models or Derivatives that expressly excludes live, real-world conditions, commercial operations, revenue-generating activities, or direct interactions with or impacts on end users (such as, for instance, Your employees or customers). Non-Production Environment may include, but is not limited to, any setting, use case, or application for research, development, testing, quality assurance, training, internal evaluation (other than any internal usage by employees in the context of the employer’s commercial business activities), and demonstration purposes by You.
